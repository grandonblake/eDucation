# eDucation
A simple locally-hosted School Management System using Java MySQL while implementing the Model-View-Controller Architecture.

This project was a group effort that was submitted on Oct 14, 2021 as a Final Project requirement during my 2nd year in College.

## About
The system “eDucation” is intended to provide an online platform that is accessible for both students and teachers. The system is expected to provide benefits to both parties, whereas:
- Students have the convenience of accessing their information through the portal and can view their student profile, grade, and schedule.
- Students can register and can enroll in their subjects and choose their preferred time and day. It is going to display in their schedule if they enrolled in that subject with its corresponding time.
- Teachers have access and can view the student’s list easily.
- Teachers can access schedules, where they can see their availability in terms of time and be able to manage their schedule ahead of them.
- As the programmers will be using MySQL to store the database information, data handling will be more efficient and organized. It will eliminate the fear of getting the information lost, screwing up data, and getting exposed to unauthorized access.
